### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
cd loan_app
python app.py
```

The application will start on: **http://localhost:5000**

- 4 = Student

**Loan Purpose:**
- 0 = Debt Consolidation
- 1 = Car Purchase
- 2 = Home Improvement
- 3 = Education
- 4 = Business
- 5 = Medical
- 6 = Vacation
- 7 = Other

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)
- **Route `/`:** Renders home page
- **Route `/predict`:** Handles form submission and prediction
- **Route `/api/predict`:** JSON API for programmatic access

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Extract form data
2. Create feature array (11 features)
3. Scale features using loaded StandardScaler
4. Pass to MLP model for prediction
5. Return probability and risk assessment

### Error Handling
- Input validation
- Model loading verification
- Exception catching with user-friendly messages

## 📸 Screenshots

### Home Page
Clean, intuitive input form for loan applications

### Result Page
- Color-coded prediction (Green = Approved, Red = High Risk)
- Confidence percentage
- Probability breakdown visualization
- Risk level indicator (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Summary of input values

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Model not found"
- **Solution:** Ensure `loan_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` are in the same directory as `app.py`

**Issue:** "Feature mismatch"
- **Solution:** Verify categorical values are correctly encoded (0-based integers)

**Issue:** Port already in use
- **Solution:** Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`

## 📝 Development Notes

- Model was trained using Scikit-learn's MLPClassifier
- Preprocessing includes IQR outlier removal and standard scaling
- Class imbalance (80/20) handled during training
- Stratified train-test split maintained class distribution
